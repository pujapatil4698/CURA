		<b>1. Chintakindi Mallesam</b>, a grassroot innovator was born in a traditional weaver’s family in Sharajpet, Aleru Mandal, Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district in the state of Telangana, India. He started learning weaving from his parents at the age of 10 years. </br>
		Later, he moved into his family’s occupation which has been pursuing the tradition of weaving Pochampalli saris for several generations. The entire design of the saris is totally dependent on this Asu process which took 8-9 hours to weave just two to three saris per day.Mr. C. Mallesam thought if there could be an alternative method for Asu that would mean better living conditions as well as less physical drudgery for his mother which led to his famous automated Asu machine that he named after his mother as <b>Laxmi Asu Handloom Machine</b>. The first machine was made in the year 1999 and got an overwhelming response to his invention in the weaver community. His invention became prominent and received various accolades and awards from the state and central governments. In the year 2017, he received the <b>Padma Shri</b> award under the category of Science and Engineering for his invention, <b>Laxmi Asu</b> Machine.
