		<p align="justify" style="font-size: 100%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cura is a momentous management event organised by the students of School of Management every year to encourage budding managers from various B-schools across the country to develop & display their multifaceted skills. Cura signifying "Thoughtfulness" is a platform that started in 2009 to unleash the potential of the management aspirants all over India. Stalwarts from premier B-schools like ISB, IIMs, XIMB, SIBM etc. & doyens from the industry graced the occasion by their scintillating presence & captivating lectures during previous CURA events. Continuing this legacy, we are back with CURA’23 on February 17th and 18th. We are organizing events, workshops, and keynote sessions as part of Cura.</br>
 		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CURA’ 23 – Igniting your Zeal , is poised to bring out the latent strategic mindset of the budding managers to sustain in today’s challenging new business scenario for building a promising tomorrow. This fest entails a myriad of management and engineering students from B-Schools and colleges across the nation including IIMs, IITs and NITs.</br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every student in an educational institution will be aware of the departmental event's happenings. So what is so special about CURA? Isn’t this any other normal event which is heard of? The answer is NO. We can learn technical skills at this management-focused event, but we can also have a lot of fun and learn from people with all degrees of competence. Depending on their preferences and interests, the students can actively participate in a variety of events. Students who are not drawn to technical matters can nevertheless participate in general activities and earn significant prizes.</br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, there are keynote addresses from well-known members of society, which allow students to gain a wealth of knowledge from their experiences and interact with one another directly. We may always say that we learn from the experiences we have had, but talking to people who have been where we are now and are succeeding in their careers helps us feel more optimistic and accessible about the future. These kinds of priceless lessons can be learned through the keynote briefings provided by CURA in the pertinent management field.</br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CURA's dynamism is about to begin! By taking part in a variety of games, cultural events, workshops, different food stalls, and other activities arranged by the students, the registered students can become involved and feel rejuvenated. Therefore, CURA's management programme involves participation in numerous activities that perfectly match your test and significant academic essential learnings. Join us in ensuring the success of this event by enrolling in one of the many programmes we'll be running. You never know what hidden skill you could possess, so why not let the world see it?
