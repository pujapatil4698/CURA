The Institute never stops aiming for higher standards of technical competence. Our interests include developing a socially relevant curriculum that is also internationally accepted, utilizing cutting-edge teaching techniques, and emphasizing the students' overall growth. UNESCO and the UK's help in the past allowed for the completion of numerous developmental projects.
