		<p align="justify" style="font-size: 100%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the contemporary world of rapidly changing global business, which are technology intensive and consumer oriented, the acumen needed for managers is being revolutionised. Recognizing this, the institute has designed a comprehensive MBA programme exclusively for engineers. Thus came to light the “School Of Management (SOM)” at NIT Warangal. National Institute of Technology Warangal (NITW), in 2000, established the Centre for Management Studies. Later, renamed as School of Management (SOM). The School of Management provides a well-balanced combination of academic and practical business oriented content. The updated curriculum with its wide range of video materials, databases like prowess, case studies, research projects and other tools aim at enhancing the understanding of the business reality and also imbibing problem-solving skills.</br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A perfect blend of academic and non-academic learning that goes beyond the traditional classroom method characterizes life at SOM as a fascinating trip through education. The main goal is to transform engineers into managerial professionals who are able to handle issues on both a national and worldwide scale and to advance value-based growth. The department's teaching practices are guided by the emancipation of thought rather than by any set of rules. Modern AC classrooms are outfitted with Wi-Fi-enabled web architecture and cyberinfrastructure, granting access to the most recent software and statistical packages like IBM SPSS, industry databases like Capitaline Plus, and routinely updated electronic journal databases containing articles from both national and international journals.</br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom learning takes place in the classroom by fusing "lectures" with actual "case studies" and student-faculty interactions, student seminars, in-basket exercises, field experiences, presentations, and industry interactions, all of which are accompanied by a continuous evaluation pattern.</br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general personality development of students is also given a lot of attention in order to grow them into future leaders. The students take part in all of the activities with great fervor and also plan academic and cultural events. Such an eclectic approach to pedagogy loosens the reins of conventional thinking to generate a more holistic train of thought and, in turn, unleashes the students' dormant skills that are compatible with the constantly shifting competitive landscape in an age of globalization. The SOM aims to develop in its members a wide range of interests covering many real-world challenges as well as the capacity to become "Leaders of Tomorrow." It's no surprise that our graduates are employed by reputable companies across a variety of industries.
